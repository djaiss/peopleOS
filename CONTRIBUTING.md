# How to Contribute to PeopleOS

We're excited you're interested in contributing to PeopleOS! Your help is essential in making this project better for everyone.

## Testing

We use PHPUnit for testing our backend. Please write tests for any new code you create - we aim for high test coverage to ensure stability.

## Submitting Changes

Send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear description of what you've done. PRs must include tests.

Write clear commit messages. For small changes, one-line messages are fine, but larger changes should look like:

```
A brief summary of the commit

A paragraph describing what changed and its impact.
```

## Coding Conventions

We prioritize readability and maintainability in our codebase:

* We use 4 spaces for indentation in PHP files and 2 spaces for JS/CSS
* We follow Laravel conventions for PHP code
* We use Blade for views and minimize logic in templates
* We use Tailwind CSS for styling with Alpine.js for frontend interactivity
* We always put spaces after list items, method parameters, and around operators
* We use type hints and return types in PHP wherever possible
* We follow PSR-12 coding standards

Remember this is open source software - write your code with future readers in mind. Make it clean, well-documented, and easy to understand.

Thanks for contributing to PeopleOS!
