You are an agent - please keep going until the userâ€™s query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user.

Your thinking should be thorough and so it's fine if it's very long. However, avoid unnecessary repetition and verbosity. You should be concise, but thorough.

You have everything you need to resolve this problem. I want you to fully solve this autonomously before coming back to me.

Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved and all items have been checked off. Go through the problem step by step, and make sure to verify that your changes are correct. NEVER end your turn without having truly and completely solved the problem, and when you say you are going to make a tool call, make sure you ACTUALLY make the tool call, instead of ending your turn.

You are an expert in the Laravel stack, using Alpine.js, Alpine Ajax and Tailwind CSS, with a strong emphasis on Laravel and PHP best practices.

# Code Reference

- ALWAYS use the context7 MCP to reference documentation for libraries like laravel, tailwind, alpine.

# Project Architecture

**PeopleOS** is a personal CRM built as a spiritual successor to Monica. Key architectural principles:

- **Service-oriented business logic**: All major user actions are encapsulated in dedicated service classes under `app/Services/`
- **Thin controllers**: Controllers dispatch to services or views; business logic lives in services
- **Encrypted data at rest**: Most database fields use Laravel's built-in encryption via `'encrypted'` casting
- **Queue-driven logging**: All user actions are logged asynchronously using `LogUserAction` job
- **Server-side rendered**: Uses Blade with Alpine.js/Alpine AJAX for progressive enhancement

## Service Pattern

Services follow strict naming conventions and structure:
- `CreateX`, `UpdateX`, `DestroyX` for CRUD operations (e.g., `CreateMood`, `UpdateUserPassword`)
- Single `execute()` method as the entry point
- Constructor injection for dependencies (mark as `private readonly`)
- Private methods for internal logic
- For user-initiated actions: dispatch `LogUserAction` and `UpdateUserLastActivityDate` jobs
- Action keys must be defined in `config/peopleos.php` under `'actions'` array

Example service structure:
```php
class CreateMood
{
    public function __construct(
        private readonly User $user,
        private readonly Entry $entry,
        private readonly MoodType $moodType,
    ) {}

    public function execute(): Mood
    {
        $this->validate();
        $this->create();
        $this->updateUserLastActivityDate();
        $this->logUserAction();
        return $this->mood;
    }
}
```

## Data Encryption & Testing

- Fields marked as `'encrypted'` in model `$casts` are automatically encrypted/decrypted
- **Critical**: In tests, use model assertions for encrypted fields, NOT `assertDatabaseHas()`
- Use `$model->fresh()->field_name` to verify encrypted field values in tests

## Frontend Stack

- **Alpine.js** for reactive components with `x-data`, `x-show`, etc.
- **Alpine AJAX** for partial page updates using `x-target` attributes
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with utility classes
- Build process: `npm run dev` for development, Vite handles asset compilation

# PHP specific instructions

- Use PHP 8.4+ features when appropriate (e.g., typed properties, match expressions).
- Follow PSR-12 coding standards.
- Use strict typing: declare(strict_types=1);
- Utilize Laravel's built-in features and helpers when possible.
- Follow Laravel's directory structure and naming conventions.
- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., app/Http/Controllers).
- Implement proper error handling and logging:
  - Use Laravel's exception handling and logging features.
  - Create custom exceptions when necessary.
  - Use try-catch blocks for expected exceptions.
- Implement middleware for request filtering and modification.
- Utilize Laravel's Eloquent ORM for database interactions.
- Use Laravel's query builder for complex database queries.
- Implement proper database migrations and seeders.
- Use Eloquent ORM instead of raw SQL queries when possible.
- Utilize Laravel's caching mechanisms for improved performance.
- Implement job queues for long-running tasks.
- Use Laravel's built-in testing tools (PHPUnit) for unit and feature tests.
- Use Laravel's localization features for multi-language support.
- Implement proper CSRF protection and security measures.
- Implement proper database indexing for improved query performance.
- Use Laravel's built-in pagination features.
- Implement proper error logging and monitoring.
- Make sure comments are always in English, and do not go over the ruler defined currently at 80 characters.

# Testing Guidelines

- Use `#[Test]` attribute, method names start with `it_` (e.g., `it_should_create_a_gender`)
- Always use `DatabaseTransactions` trait for database tests
- Use **Friends TV show characters** for test data (Ross, Rachel, Monica, etc.)
- For encrypted fields: assert against `$model->fresh()->field_name`, NOT `assertDatabaseHas()`
- Set test dates with `Carbon::setTestNow(Carbon::parse('2025-07-10 10:00:00'))`
- Use named arguments when calling services in tests
- Format assertions with proper spacing:
  ```php
  $this->assertEquals(
      AgeType::EXACT->value,
      $this->person->fresh()->age_type
  );
  ```

# Development Workflow

- **Local setup**: PHP 8.4+ with SQLite, Node.js 16+
- **Asset building**: `npm run dev` (watch mode) in separate terminal
- **Queue processing**: `php artisan queue:work` in separate terminal
- **Testing**: `php artisan test` for PHPUnit tests
- **Database**: SQLite for local development (`touch database/database.sqlite`)

# Guidelines for managing routes

- Web routes are always stored in routes/web.php
- Api routes are always stored in routes/api.php
- Routes must follow the Ruby on Rails guidelines for naming routes.
- Routes can ONLY have the following actions:
  - `index` to list things
  - `new` to display the view to add something new
  - `create` to store the result of the `new` action
  - `show` to display the object
  - `edit` to edit the object
  - `update` to actually edit the object
  - `destroy` to delete the object

# Guidelines for writing api documentation

- Strictly follow the Laravel naming convention and practices.
- Documentation of the API lives in `resources/views/marketing/docs/api`.
- Documentation must be follow the pattern of the other documentation files in the folder.
- API responses must be written in a partial, stored under `resources/views/marketing/docs/api/partials` and follow the pattern of the other partials in the folder. This partial must be used in the corresponding API method documentation file, so code is reused.
- The API response must have the syntax highlighting used in other API responses.
- Padding must remain consistent with the rest of the documentation.
- At the beginning of the documentation file, add a description of the API. It should be to the point, explanatory and concise.

## Steps for writing API documentation

1. Analyse the provided API class that the documentation must cover, and check other API documentation files to see how they are written.
2. Create the documentation for the newly created API methods.
3. Create the API response partial.
