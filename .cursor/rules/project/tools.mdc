We always use tools at their latest version.

- We use Laravel and follow its conventions.
- We use Tailwind for CSS.
- We use Alpine for JS.
- We use Alpine Ajax to make AJAX queries.
- We use static analysis with PHPStan.
- All tests are written with PHPUnit. I hate Pest.
- We use Composer and npm.
- Views are simple Blade files.
