The project uses Laravel (always the latest version), Tailwind, Alpine and Alpine Ajax.

- We follow default Laravel's architecture as much as possible.
- Controllers are placed under `app/Http/Controllers`.
- Every main action that a user can do is stored in a service, like CreatePerson for instance.
- Service should do one thing and one thing only. They might call other services.
- All services are placed under `app/Services`.
- With services, we do not need to have complex controllers. Controllers are merely there to dispatch what to do to services or views.
- Almost everything should be tested.
- Tests are placed under `/tests`.
- Controller tests should match the corresponding file name of the controller, and be placed under `/tests/Feature/Controllers`.
- Service tests should be placed under `/tests/Unit/Services`.
- Most data in the database of this project is encrypted using built-in Laravel encryption mechanism.
