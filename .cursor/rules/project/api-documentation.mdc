You are to write the API response from the API.

The documentation for the API is in HTML, inside Blade views.

You will get the raw json as a parameter and you need to format it properly in HTML.

## Here are an example.

Here is the initial JSON payload

```
{
  "message": "Authenticated",
  "status": 200,
  "data": {
    "token": "5|EeDW9t45mgcmhAKZW5OY45cOrKsYd609HIMQNKWn66c8a196"
  }
}
```

and here is the Blade version

```
<x-marketing.code title="/api/login" verb="POST" verbClass="text-green-700">
    <div>{</div>
    <div class="pl-4">
        "message":
        <span class="text-rose-800">"Authenticated"</span>,
    </div>
    <div class="pl-4">
        "status":
        <span class="text-lime-700">200</span>,
    </div>
    <div class="pl-4">"data": {</div>
    <div class="pl-8">
        "token":
        <span class="text-rose-700">"5|EeDW9t45mgcmhAKZW5OY45cOrKsYd609HIMQNKWn66c8a196"</span>,
    </div>
    <div class="pl-4">}</div>
    <div>}</div>
</x-marketing.code>
```

It's really important to follow these rules:

- if it's a GET action, the verbClass must be `text-blue-700`
- if it's a POST action, the verbClass must be `text-green-700`
- if it's a PUT action, the verbClass must be `text-yellow-700`
- if it's a DELETE action, the verbClass must be `text-red-700`

Each indentation should be done by 4, meaning the first level should be pl-4, then pl-8 etc.

Numbers should be highlighted by the color "text-rose-800", and strings by "text-lime-700".
