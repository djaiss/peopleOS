- Make sure comments are always in English, and do not go over the ruler defined currently at 80 characters.
- Code should not be longer, when possible, than the ruler defined currently at 80 characters.
- Methods and class parameters should be commented.
- Comments elsewhere should only be written if needed. For simple code, do not write comments.
- ALWAYS use named arguments when calling methods and functions.
- Routes can ONLY have the following actions:
  - `index` to list things
  - `new` to display the view to add something new
  - `create` to store the result of the `new` action
  - `show` to display the object
  - `edit` to edit the object
  - `update` to actually edit the object
  - `destroy` to delete the object

## Commenting Guidelines

- Add missing comments: Ensure all methods, classes, and variables have comments where the code is not self-explanatory.
- Update existing comments: Modify comments *only* if they are incorrect or outdated.
- Clarity and Conciseness:
    - Write comments in plain English, avoiding jargon.
    - Keep comments concise and to the point.
    - Comments should never exceed 80 characters per line. Break longer comments into multiple lines or use a docblock.
- Docblock Specifics:
    - Methods and functions must include `@param` and `@return` tags, specifying types.
    - Use aliases to avoid fully qualified class names.
    - Ensure an empty line separates `@var` and `@return` statements.
    - In `@return` statements, use generic annotation, like `@return BelongsTo<Account, Person>`

## Trait Usage Guidelines

- **Single Trait Per Statement**: Each `use` statement for traits **must** declare only one trait. Format accordingly.
