# Your routes

- Web routes are always stored in routes/web.php
- Api routes are always stored in routes/api.php
- Routes must follow the Ruby on Rails guidelines for naming routes.
- Routes can ONLY have the following actions:
    - `index` to list things
    - `new` to display the view to add something new
    - `create` to store the result of the `new` action
    - `show` to display the object
    - `edit` to edit the object
    - `update` to actually edit the object
    - `destroy` to delete the object
