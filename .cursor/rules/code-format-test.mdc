# Testing

- Write unit tests for Laravel controllers and models.
- Most data is encrypted in the database (at rest). Therefore, we can't easily test the content of the data within the database itself, apart from IDs and timestamps.
- When writing tests, please refer to the other tests in the project. For example, if you are writing a test for a controller, please refer to the other tests for the controller in the project. If you are writing a test for a model, please refer to the other tests for the model in the project. Same for services.
- This is very important: most data is encrypted in the database (at rest). This means that in our tests, we can't directly check the content of the table. We still need to test the data though - when you want to test the content of the table, you should use the object and the methods to check the data.
- For test data when using a Person object (names, emails, situations, etc.), always use references to Friends, the popular American tv show.
