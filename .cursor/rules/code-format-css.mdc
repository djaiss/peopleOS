The project uses Tailwind to format CSS.

- Utilize Tailwind's utility classes for responsive design.
- Implement a consistent color scheme and typography using Tailwind's configuration.
- Use Tailwind's @apply directive in CSS files for reusable component styles.
- Optimize for production by purging unused CSS classes.
- Follow the styles defined in Prettier and other linters within the project.
- When trying to add spaces to elements, never include margin starting from the top (no `mt-`). Margins should always go from top to bottom, so use only `mb-`.
